This repo contains my project on course "Computer Architecture".
Program name is GuitarTuner. It is used for acoustic guitar settings.
Currently program is compiled for Linux but it can be easily compiled
for other platforms because I used cross-platform languages, tools, 
libraries. In this project you can see the usage of C++, Qt 4.8, 
complex FFT, PortAudio.
